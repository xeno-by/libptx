This project requires XenoGears source code rather than binaries.
Expected source location: ..\XenoGears (relative to the root of this checkout)
You can get source code as follows: hg clone https://xenogears.googlecode.com/hg/

I'm using such a simple mechanism of referencing a 3rd-party codebase since at the moment XenoGears is still very much in flux.
Thus, to make it easier to spot and fix bugs I've decided to use this code sharing scheme despite of possible instability introduced by totally uncontrollable reference.
