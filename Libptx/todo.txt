todo list for the Libptx library:

9) bidirectional transformation: [plain text] <=> [object model]
10) stubs for bidirectional transformation: [binary] <=> [object model]
11) e-DSL notions:
 * state-modifying props for Var and Type (e.g. foo.h0)
 * the latter includes also operators ! and - for Vars and, generally, where appropriate
 * [] for Addressable
 * Addressable -> Address shortcut, e.g. the "addr()" method or property
 * + and - operators for Addressable and Address
 * Ret prop for Callable (which is implemented as AssertSingle, of course)
 * u/d casts where appropriate: T <-> Type, T <-> String and so on
 * shortcuts for specials, instructions, directives: ctors, static methods, extensions ala ILTrait, whatever
12) implement tostrings for all
13) add readme.txt (similarly as for Libcuda)
14) todo for readme.txt: 2.0 ABI is not implemented
15) todo for readme.txt: variadic functions are not implemented
16) todo for readme.txt: indirect calls and jumps are not implemented (same for .branchtargets, .calltargets and .callprototype)
