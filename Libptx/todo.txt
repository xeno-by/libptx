todo list for the Libptx library:

9) bidirectional transformation: [plain text] <=> [object model]
10) stubs for bidirectional transformation: [binary] <=> [object model]
12) implement tostrings for all
13) add readme.txt (similarly as for Libcuda)
14) todo for readme.txt: 2.0 ABI is not implemented
15) todo for readme.txt: variadic functions are not implemented
16) todo for readme.txt: indirect calls and jumps are not implemented (same for .branchtargets, .calltargets and .callprototype)
19) convenient inits for bX, bX.vY and bX[.vY]+[] constants
21) todo for readme.txt: no funcs - no doubts with extern, no necessity to invent pretty AddFunc signatures, no necessity to implement calls and ABIs, no Callable (i.e. no bras to funcs)
23) todo for readme.txt: bit buckets - too much work finding out what instructions support them
24) todo for readme.txt: hasn't passed rigorous testing
25) check that we validate everything including tiniest particles
